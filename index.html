      <div class="words">I'm Qianyu Xiang. I'm from China. For the past years, I have been so fortunate to study and live in different cities as Shenzhen, Guangzhou and finally New York! <br/>
  As an urban planning student in GSAPP with interests in data analytics and built environment, I found it exciting to explore the city in my own way. Through various projects and photographs, I can see the diversity and dynamics of a city, which really fascinates me a lot.<br/>
  NOW, it's time for us to think city creatively and make some difference to the world!</div>
